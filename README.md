# Loimos
Loimos is a parallel, agent-based simulator for modeling the spread of infectious diseases.
This simulator employs a combination of time-stepping and descrete event simulations to capture
population dynamics in realisitic social contact networks. These networks are *digital twins*
of various U.S. states built based on a variety of sources, including census and survey data,
which are then used as input for various outbreak simulations. The simulator itself is implmented
on top of the [Charm++](https://github.com/UIUC-PPL/charm) parallel runtime.
